### Case Study: Mental Health in Tech

People with mental disorders experience disproportionately higher rates of disability and mortality. For example, persons with major depression and schizophrenia have a 40% to 60% greater chance of dying prematurely than the general population. Suicide is the second most common cause of death among young people worldwide. Less than half of the 139 countries that have mental health policies and plans report having these aligned with human rights conventions. (https://www.who.int/)

The World Health Organisation(WHO) wants to provide companies know :

* How does the frequency of mental health illness and attitudes towards mental health vary by geographic location ?
* What are the strongest predictors of mental health illness and specific attitudes towards mental health in the workplace?
